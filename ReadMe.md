#  RocketOrbit-Lab

**RocketOrbit-Lab** is a simulation lab that models a rocket's complete journey from **launch to orbit**. It combines rocket thrust simulation, burn and coast phases, and satellite orbital animation â€” all controlled through an intuitive GUI built using Python and Tkinter.

##  What It Does

###  Rocket Launch Simulation
- Choose from standard motor classes (Aâ€“D)
- Input physical characteristics:
  - Rocket mass
  - Fuel weight
  - Diameter
  - Drag coefficient
- Simulates:
  - Burn phase: thrust, acceleration, and altitude
  - Coasting phase after burnout
  - Apogee (peak altitude) calculation
- Outputs:
  - Velocity, altitude, and acceleration plots
  - Full flight profile

### ðŸ›° Satellite Orbit Simulation
- Auto-launches after apogee calculation
- Uses RK4 numerical integration for orbital path
- Real-time animation with:
  - Radial distance
  - Velocity display
  - Stable orbit
  

  - Crash detection if satellite falls back
